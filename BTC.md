| **Dec 17** | **22.26** | **29.24** | **Oversold** |

**Stochastic Analysis:** The Stochastic oscillator has entered oversold territory (<20 on %K), suggesting potential for a bounce. The %K crossing below %D is bearish, but oversold readings often precede reversals.

#### MACD (12,26,9)
The MACD data shows the recent price action with the indicator configured at standard 12/26/9 settings. Recent closes have been declining from the Dec 3 peak of $93,430, indicating bearish momentum divergence.

### Trend Indicators

| SMA (50) | $94,942 | Below (-7.9%) | Bearish |

**MA Analysis:** Price trading below both the 20 EMA and 50 SMA indicates bearish intermediate-term trend. The 7.9% discount to the 50 SMA suggests significant selling pressure.

| Dec 14 | 22.22 | Very Weak |
| Dec 15 | 20.00 | Very Weak |
| **Dec 16** | **25.56** | **Weak** |

### Component Scores (Latest - Dec 16)
| Score Type | Value (0-10) | Assessment |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Overall Rating** | 2.56 | Very Weak |
| Sentiment Score | 0 | Extremely Weak |
| Accumulation Score | 9 | Very Strong |
| Demand Shock Score | 2 | Weak |
| Leverage Score | 7 | Strong (risk!) |
| Price Strength Score | 1 | Very Weak |

### Rating Analysis:

**Bullish Signals:**
- **Accumulation Score: 9/10** - Smart money/whales are accumulating despite price weakness
- **Leverage Score: 7/10** - Market is not overleveraged, room for expansion

**Bearish Signals:**
- **Sentiment Score: 0/10** - Extremely negative sentiment (potential contrarian buy signal)
- **Price Strength Score: 1/10** - Very weak relative strength
- **Demand Shock Score: 2/10** - Low buying pressure

**Interpretation:** The divergence between high accumulation and low sentiment is notable. This pattern often precedes trend reversals as smart money accumulates while retail sentiment is at lows.

## Divine Dip Metric

The Divine Dip indicator detects significant price dips that may represent buying opportunities.

| Date | Divine Dip Signal |
|------|------------------|
| Nov 19 | ✅ **DIP DETECTED** |
| Nov 20 | ✅ **DIP DETECTED** |
| Nov 21 | ✅ **DIP DETECTED** |
| Nov 22 - Dec 17 | ❌ No signal |

**Analysis:** The last Divine Dip signals occurred during the Nov 19-21 selloff when BTC dropped from $92K to $80.6K. No new dip signals have triggered since, suggesting the recent decline hasn't met the threshold for a "significant" dip opportunity. This could mean:
1. Current decline is gradual rather than panic-driven
2. A sharper correction may be needed to trigger the indicator
