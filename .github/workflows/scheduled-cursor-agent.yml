          PROMPT=$(cat <<'PROMPT_EOF'
          You are an autonomous data pipeline agent. Execute the following pipeline with self-verification:

          ## PHASE 1: DATA FETCHING (use panda MCP)
          1. Use the panda MCP tool `search_polymarket_markets` with query "Bitcoin" to find all BTC prediction markets
          2. Also search for "BTC" to catch any markets using the ticker
          3. Collect: market titles, probabilities, volumes, end dates, outcomes

          ## PHASE 2: DATA PROCESSING
          Create/update `polymarket_btc_data.json` with this EXACT structure:
          ```json
          {
            "metadata": {
              "source": "Polymarket via Cursor Agent + Panda MCP",
              "fetchedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
              "asset": "Bitcoin (BTC)", 
              "totalMarketsFound": <count>,
              "totalBTCVolume": "<formatted like $27.8M>",
              "pipelineVersion": "2.0.0"
            },
            "summary": {
              "totalMarkets": <count>,
              "priceMarketsVolume": "<formatted>",
              "corporateMarketsVolume": "<formatted>",
              "tradeSentiment": "BULLISH" | "BEARISH" | "NEUTRAL",
              "buyRatio": <0-100>,
              "sellRatio": <0-100>,
              "buySellRatio": <ratio>
            },
            "markets": {
              "priceTargets": {
                "marketName": "What price will Bitcoin hit in 2026?",
                "totalVolume": <number>,
                "endDate": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
                "outcomes": {
                  "active": {
                    "upTargets": [{"target": "↑ $100,000", "probability": <0-100>, "volume": <number>, "direction": "up"}],
                    "downTargets": [{"target": "↓ $75,000", "probability": <0-100>, "volume": <number>, "direction": "down"}]
                  }
                }
              },
              "weeklyPriceTargets": {...},
              "corporate": {...},
              "raceMarkets": [...]
            },
            "aiInsights": {
              "summary": "<2-3 sentence market analysis>",
              "keyObservations": ["<insight 1>", "<insight 2>", ...],
              "riskLevel": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH"
            }
          }
          ```

          ## PHASE 3: SELF-VERIFICATION LOOP
          After creating the JSON:
          1. Read back the file and validate:
             - All required fields present
             - Probabilities are 0-100
             - buyRatio + sellRatio ≈ 100
             - Volumes are positive numbers
             - Dates are valid ISO format
          2. Check the React components in src/components/PolymarketCharts.tsx to ensure data matches expected props
          3. If ANY errors found, fix them and re-validate
          4. Repeat until validation passes (max 5 iterations)

          ## PHASE 4: DASHBOARD UPDATE (if needed)
          Based on the fetched data:
          1. Check if any React components in src/components/ need updates to display new market types
          2. If new market categories appear that aren't handled, add chart components for them
          3. Update src/app/page.tsx if the dashboard layout needs adjustment
          4. Ensure all TypeScript types in src/lib/types.ts match the data structure

          ## PHASE 5: COMMIT (to main branch)
          Once validated:
          1. Ensure you're on the `main` branch: `git checkout main`
          2. Stage all changes: `git add polymarket_btc_data.json src/`
          3. Commit with message: "chore: update Polymarket BTC data and dashboard via Cursor agent"
          4. Push to main branch: `git push origin main`

          ## IMPORTANT
          - Use panda MCP for fetching (search_polymarket_markets tool)
          - Process probabilities as percentages (0-100), not decimals
          - Calculate sentiment: if average upside probability > 50%, it's BULLISH
          - Generate meaningful AI insights based on the actual market data
          - DO NOT skip the self-verification loop
